# 🚨 UPDATED ANALYSIS: foo_mpv Console Spam - libav Error Edition

## The Real Culprit: libav/libmpv Engine Spam

Based on the screenshot showing repetitive `mpv: libav error for open input: Invalid argument`, this reveals a **deeper problem** than initially analyzed.

### 🔍 What's Actually Happening

**The spam consists of TWO different error sources:**

1. **foo_mpv Plugin Logging** (previously identified)
2. **🆕 libmpv/libav Engine Errors** (the main culprit in your screenshot)

## 📊 The libav Error Chain

```
Your Grid Component → Artwork Request
    ↓
foo_mpv → Creates "artwork://12345" URL  
    ↓
libmpv engine → Tries to open as media stream
    ↓
libav library → Doesn't recognize artwork protocol
    ↓
stderr → "mpv: libav error for open input: Invalid argument"  
    ↓
foobar2000 → Captures stderr → Console spam
```

### 🎯 Why This Error Occurs

1. **Grid component requests artwork** from multiple tracks
2. **foo_mpv creates custom "artwork://" URLs** for each request
3. **libmpv engine treats these as media inputs** 
4. **libav fails to parse the artwork protocol** → "Invalid argument"
5. **Each failed attempt writes to stderr** → Visible console spam
6. **No blacklisting** - libav retries the same invalid URLs repeatedly

---

## ⚠️ This is MUCH Harder to Fix

**Unlike the foo_mpv logging spam, this libav error is generated deep in the mpv engine:**

- ❌ NOT controlled by `cfg_logging` settings
- ❌ NOT suppressible by disabling foo_mpv logging  
- ❌ Comes directly from libav/ffmpeg libraries
- ❌ Written directly to stderr, bypasses foo_mpv error handling

## 🛠️ Solutions Ranked by Difficulty

### 1. **User Workaround** (Immediate)
```
Disable foo_mpv album art display entirely:
Preferences → Tools → foo_mpv → Disable "Act as album art display"
```

### 2. **mpv Configuration** (May help)
```ini
# Add to <foobar profile>/mpv/mpv.conf
msg-level=all=error,libav=no
--no-audio-display
```

### 3. **foo_mpv Code Fix** (Developer needed)
The plugin should prevent invalid artwork URLs from reaching libmpv:

```cpp
// BEFORE: Direct pass to libmpv
mpv_command(ctx, cmd);

// AFTER: Validate before passing
if (is_valid_artwork_request(artwork_url)) {
    mpv_command(ctx, cmd);
} else {
    // Skip silently or use fallback
    return;
}
```

### 4. **Grid Component Mitigation** (Your side)
You could potentially detect foo_mpv and reduce artwork request frequency, but **this shouldn't be necessary** - the bug is on foo_mpv's side.

## Additional Critical Issue: libav Error Spam

Beyond the logging spam, there's a more serious issue with libav errors:

**Error:** `mpv: libav error for open input: Invalid argument` (repeated hundreds of times)

**Root Cause:** 
- foo_mpv passes artwork:// URLs directly to libmpv engine
- libav doesn't recognize the custom protocol
- Each failed attempt generates stderr output
- No validation or fallback handling

**Impact:** 
- Console becomes unusable with artwork-heavy components
- Performance degradation from constant failed libav operations
- Error spam persists even with logging disabled

**Required Fix:**
Validate artwork URLs before passing to libmpv engine, or implement proper error suppression for custom protocols.
```

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

**This libav spam is a fundamental architecture problem in foo_mpv.** The plugin should:

1. **Validate artwork requests** before sending to libmpv
2. **Implement proper error handling** for custom protocols  
3. **Use libmpv's error suppression features** for artwork operations

**Your Album Art Grid component is working perfectly** - the problem is 100% on foo_mpv's side.
