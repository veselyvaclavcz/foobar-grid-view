[b]Album Art Grid v9.7.0 Released - Enhanced Badge Edition[/b]

Quick update based on user feedback - the track count badge system has been improved!

[b]What's New in v9.7.0:[/b]
• [color=#00AA00]IMPROVED:[/color] Track count badge is now ALWAYS visible when enabled
• [color=#00AA00]CLEANER:[/color] Removed duplicate track count from text labels
• Badge appears consistently in top-right corner of album art
• Badge uses your exact UI font settings for perfect consistency
• Simplified display - no more duplicate information

[b]How it Works:[/b]
• When "Show track count" is enabled → Badge always appears on album art
• Text labels now show only album/folder names (no count duplication)
• Tooltip behavior unchanged (appears when hovering over images with labels hidden)

[b]Previous Features (Still Included):[/b]
• Artist image support for artist-based groupings (v9.5)
• 13 grouping modes and 11 sorting options
• Auto-fill mode with Ctrl+Mouse Wheel (3-10 columns)
• High-quality image rendering
• Full dark mode support

[b]Installation:[/b]
1. Download foo_albumart_grid_v97.fb2k-component
2. In foobar2000: File → Preferences → Components → Install...
3. Select the .fb2k-component file (or drag & drop it)
4. Restart foobar2000 when prompted

[b]Configuration:[/b]
Right-click on the component → Settings:
• "Show track count" → Displays badge on all album art
• "Show labels" → Shows/hides text labels below album art

[b]Why This Change?[/b]
Users reported that with 2-line labels, the track count at the end was often cut off and invisible. The badge solution ensures the count is always visible while keeping labels clean and uncluttered.
