### 2025-01-09 - Session 1
**Duration**: Initial Setup  
**Focus**: Project restructuring and architecture design  
**Modules Affected**: All (structure creation)  

#### Completed
- Analyzed SDK patterns and crash causes from v10.0.17
- Created complete feature specification
- Designed 5-layer modular architecture
- Archived all old versions (moved to archive_old_versions/)
- Created clean folder structure
- Set up documentation templates

#### Key Decisions
- No code reuse from old versions - complete rewrite
- Each module gets its own documentation
- Test-driven development approach
- Weak pointer pattern for callbacks
- Object validation with magic numbers

#### Next Steps
- Create LifecycleManager module (foundation layer)
- Set up basic SDK integration
- Create initial test harness
