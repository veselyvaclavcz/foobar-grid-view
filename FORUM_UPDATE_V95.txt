[UPDATE] Album Art Grid v9.5.0 - Artist Image Support Added!

Hi everyone,

Quick update to the Album Art Grid component - version 9.5.0 is now available with a frequently requested feature!

ðŸŽ¤ What's New in v9.5.0:

ARTIST IMAGE SUPPORT
The component now intelligently displays artist images when you're browsing by artist! When you select any of these grouping modes:
â€¢ By Artist
â€¢ By Album Artist
â€¢ By Artist/Album
â€¢ By Performer
â€¢ By Composer

The grid will:
â†’ First try to display the artist's image
â†’ Automatically fall back to album cover if no artist image exists
â†’ Work with both embedded artist images and your configured artist image folders

This makes browsing your music collection by artist much more visually intuitive - you'll see artist photos instead of random album covers when grouping by artist.

ðŸ“¥ Download:
GitHub: https://github.com/veselyvaclavcz/foobar-grid-view
Direct: foo_albumart_grid_v95.dll

ðŸ“‹ Quick Installation:
1. Close foobar2000
2. Copy foo_albumart_grid_v95.dll to your components folder
3. Restart foobar2000
4. Your existing settings will be preserved

ðŸ’¡ Usage Tip:
The menu now shows ðŸŽ¤ emoji next to grouping modes that support artist images, making it easy to see which modes will use this feature.

ðŸ”§ Technical Note:
This feature uses foobar2000's built-in artist image support (album_art_ids::artist), so it will automatically work with however you have artist images configured in your setup.

All existing features from v9.4 remain unchanged - this is purely an additive update focused on improving the visual experience when browsing by artist.

Thanks to everyone who suggested this feature! Let me know if you encounter any issues.

Note: If you're upgrading from v9.4, this is a drop-in replacement - all your settings will be preserved.
